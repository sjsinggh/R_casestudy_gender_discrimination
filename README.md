# R_casestudy_gender_discrimination

- In 1972, as a part of a study on gender discrimination, 48 male bank supervisorswere each given the same personnel file and asked to judge whether the person should be promoted to a branch manager job that was described as “routine”.

- The files were identical except that half of the supervisors had files showing the person was male while the other half had files showing the person was female.
- It was randomly determined which supervisors got “male” applications and which got “female” applications.
- Of the 48 files reviewed, 35 were promoted.
- The study is testing whether females are unfairly discriminated against.

### % of males promoted:21 / 24 = 0.875 87.5%
### % of females promoted:14 / 24 = 0.583 58.3%

### In this case study we will find out the probability of 29.2% (87.5% - 58.3%) difference in the promotion rates between men and women. This will lead us to know whether it is an event which is likely or something which is rare to occur thus pointing to a possible gender bias.
