### • In this case study, there are 48 identical resumes, with 24 noted as belonging to women and 24 belonging to men. Of the 48, a total of 35 people were promoted.

### • If promotion and gender are independent, meaning that receiving a promotion has nothing to do with the person being a woman or man, then we would expect the promotion rate for women to be equal to the promotion rate for men. (Remember that the 48 resumes are identical in every way other than gender of applicant.) That is,
### *(number of women promoted / total number of women) = (number of men promoted / total number of men)*

### • This is the same as saying that we would expect the difference between the two promotion rates to be 0.
